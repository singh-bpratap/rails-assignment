# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


* Below things I could not do in this test.

- Could not follow the best practices at few places.

- Could not create required APIs, I have handled HTML request instead because of lack of time.

- Could not write code to handle exceptions on creating records.

- Could not focus on functionalities because I have spend time to polish the UI by adding bootstrap.
